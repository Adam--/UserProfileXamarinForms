# UserProfileXamarinForms
A neat user profile page built with Xamarin Forms

I used this as a fun way to learn how to do dynamic theming in Xamarin Forms. Tapping the profile picture toggles between a dark and light theme.

Presently no iOS support (I don't have an mac), though supporting it should be as simple as adding image resources and adjusting some platform specific margins.
